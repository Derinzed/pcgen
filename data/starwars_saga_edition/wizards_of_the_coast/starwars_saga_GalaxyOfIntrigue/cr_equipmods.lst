Flash Suppressor/Silencer		KEY:FlashSuppressor/Silencer		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:0	DESC:The Merr-Sonn Nonsonic is a typical example of a Flash Suppressor/Silencer. Fitting over the muzzle of any Small or larger Slugthrower, this device reduces both the sound and the muzzle flash when the weapon is fired. A Flash Suppressor/Silencer imposes a -10 penalty to Perception checks to discern the sound or spot the flash of an equipped Slugthrower. It reduces the maximum Range of the weapon by two range increments.
