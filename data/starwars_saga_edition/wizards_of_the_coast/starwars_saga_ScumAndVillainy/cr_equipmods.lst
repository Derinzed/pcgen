###Block: Equipment Upgrades (Weapons)
Double Trigger		KEY:Double_Trigger		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:800	BONUS:COMBAT|BASEAB|if(count("ABILITIES","CATEGORY=FEAT","KEY=Careful Shot")>0,1,0)		DESC:A Weapon with a Double Trigger treats one trigger as a "Safety," with the second trigger being a Hair Trigger that fires when the slightest pressure is applied to it. Weapons of this type can be extremely accurate, since only a small amount of pressure is needed to fire them (Reducing the chance of moving the Weapon slightly while pulling the trigger), but this takes time and training. If a character has the Careful Shot Feat, they gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls if they Aim with a Weapon that has the Double Trigger Weapon Upgrade (Rather than the normal +1 bonus provided by the Feat).
Targetting Scope(Standard)	KEY:Targetting_Scope_standard	TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:100	DESC:A Targeting Scope is a sighting device that makes it easier to hit distant targets. However, it affords a very limited field of view, making it difficult to use. Installing a Targeting Scope on a rifle or pistol requires 10 minutes, and a DC 10 Mechanics check. Standard: A Targeting Scope (Standard) reduces the Range by one category (For example, from Medium to Short Range). However, you must Aim at your target to gain this benefit, and you lose the benefit if you change targets or lose line of sight to your target.
Targetting Scope(Enhanced Low Light)	KEY:Targetting_Scope_Enhanced_Low_Light	TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:1000	DESC:A Targeting Scope is a sighting device that makes it easier to hit distant targets. However, it affords a very limited field of view, making it difficult to use. Installing a Targeting Scope on a rifle or pistol requires 10 minutes, and a DC 10 Mechanics check. Enhanced low-light: A Targeting Scope (Enhanced Low-Light) functions the same as a Targeting Scope (Standard) in normal light. However, after Aiming at a target, it allows the wielder to ignore Concealment (But not Total Concealment) from darkness, when attacking that target.
Rangefinder		KEY:Rangefinder		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:200	DESC:Any Ranged Weapon can have a Rangefinder built into it. Such a Weapon takes no penalty when used to attack a target at Short Range. Thus, a Blaster Pistol with a Rangefinder Upgrade takes no Range penalty on attacks against targets up to 40 squares away. This is essentially an improved version of a Targeting Scope, and thus it's benefits do not stack with those of Targeting Scopes. (However, a Weapon can have both a Rangefinder and a Targeting Scope, using the latter only when Aiming at targets at Medium or Long Range.)

Bayonet Ring		KEY:BayonetRing		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:0	DESC:A Bayonet Ring is a simple upgrade added to a melee weapon of Small or lesser size. Once upgraded, the weapon can be mounted on a specific type of ranged weapon. The type of ranged weapon must be chosen at the time you install the upgrade; the weapon must be of Medium size, and it cannot require a Bipod or other mount for any normal operation (Such as a Heavy Repeating Blaster). The most common combination is placing a Vibrodagger on a Blaster Rifle, but other combinations are possible as well (Such as a Stun Baton mounted onto a Grenade Launcher, a combination preferred for riot control). While the upgraded melee weapon is mounted on its ranged weapon, the combined weapon becomes Large size, and it must be wielded in two hands. In addition, the melee weapon's damage dice increase by one step: d2s to d3s, d3s to d4s, d4s to d6s, d6s to d8s, d8s to d10s, and d10s to d12s. However, its damage type and Weapon Group stay the same despite these changes, and it is otherwise treated as a Bayonet in all respects. Both the melee weapon with the Bayonet Ring Weapon Upgrade and the ranged weapon can be used separately; mounting or removing the upgraded melee weapon requires a Move Action.
Ion Charger		KEY:IonCharger		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:3000	DESC:An Ion Charger encases a Melee Weapon in a light Ion field that flares to full strength anytime the Weapon strikes something. This causes the Melee Weapon to deal 2d6 Ion damage in addition to it's normal Melee Damage. Feats and Talents that add to a Weapon's damage (Such as the Rapid Strike Feat) have no effect on the Ion damage dealt by a Weapon with an Ion Charger (Though they increase the Weapon's base damage as normal). Ion Chargers are common on Vibroblades, and are often referred to as an "Ionite Edge."
Missile Load		KEY:MissileLoad		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:250	DESC:A Grenade's charge can be converted into a missile warhead. Once turned into a missile, the device cannot be Thrown as a Grenade. The primary advantages of Missile Loads are their greater effect and Range when fired from a Missile Launcher. (The standard missile is essentially a Missile Load for a Frag Grenade, so only other Grenades can be fitted as Missile Loads.) Increase the damage dice of the original Grenade by 50% when converted to a Missile Load. For example, an Energy Missile deals 3d8 damage (Energy Ball), and a Stun Missile deals 6d6 Stun damage (Stun Grenade).
Neutronium Reinforcement		KEY:NeutroniumReinforcement		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:200	DESC:Neutronium is a heavy, neutron-rich metallic alloy used to make Armor and reinforce Starships. It can also be used to harden and sharpen the striking or cutting surface of Melee Weapons other than Lightsabers. Any Equipment given Neutronium Reinforcement gains +5 DR (Maximum DR 15), 10 Hit Points, and +100% weight. A Slashing or Piercing Melee Weapon given Neutronium Reinforcement scores a Critical Hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20. (Only a Natural 20 is an automatic hit, however.)
Overload Switch		KEY:OverloadSwitch		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:250	DESC:An Overload Switch allows any Energy Weapon to build a feedback loop that causes it to explode. When activated as a Swift Action, the Weapon becomes an Improvised Thrown Weapon (-5 penalty on your ranged attack roll) with a 2-square Burst. A Weapon whose size is two or more steps greater than yours (Such as a Human using an E-Web Repeating Blaster) cannot be Thrown, so it will instead detonate at the end of your turn. The overloaded Weapon deals Energy damage equal to double it's normal damage dice; for example, an overloaded Blaster Pistol deals 6d6 points of Energy damage. Once the Overload Switch is used, the Weapon is destroyed. This modification cannot be added to Grenades, Mines, or other Explosives.
Pulse Charger		KEY:PulseCharger		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:2000	DESC:Any Blaster Weapon can be fitted with a Pulse Charger. A Pulse Charger forces more power into the blast chamber, producing more powerful shots at the expense of lost accuracy. This Upgrade causes a -1 penalty on all attack rolls with the Weapon, but the Weapon deals +1 point of damage per die. Thus, a Sporting Blaster Pistol with a Pulse Charger imposes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and deals 3d4+3 points of Energy damage on a hit. A Blaster with a Pulse Charger has only one-half the normal number of shots from a Power Pack.
Rapid Recycler		KEY:RapidRecycler		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:500	DESC:A Rapid Recycler allows a Blaster Weapon that normally fires only in Single-Shot mode to act in Autofire mode. (This Upgrade is not available for Weapons that have a Burst radius or Splash radius, or Weapons that specifically prohibit it.) Switching between the two firing modes is a Swift Action.
Retractible Stock		KEY:RetractibleStock		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:100	DESC:Any Rifle or Pistol (As well as Rifle- or Pistol-like Exotic Weapons (Ranged)) can have a Retractable Stock added. This Upgrade requires 1 Upgrade Slot for a Pistol, but 0 Upgrade Slots for a Rifle. (A Rifle already has a stock, which can be replaced with the Retractable Stock.) Extending or folding a Retractable Stock is a Move Action. When the Retractable Stock is folded, the following rules apply:Treat the Weapon as a Pistol for purposes of proficiency and Range.You cannot Brace the Weapon while using it in Autofire mode, even if it is an Autofire-only Weapon.When the Retractable Stock is extended, the following rules apply:Treat the Weapon as a Rifle for purposes of proficiency and Range.You take a -5 penalty on attack rolls with the Weapon if you use it in one hand (Regardless of its size relative to you).Certain Weapons come with a Retractable Stock as a standard feature, as detailed in their descriptions. No Upgrade Slots are spent in this case.
Slinker		KEY:Slinker		TYPE:Slug	COST:1000	DESC:Only slugthrowers and missile weapons can be Upgraded with as Slinkers. Once a Weapon is made a Slinker, it can no longer fire normal ammunition (And Slinker ammunition costs twice the normal price). Slinkers are equipped with simple sensors and battle computers, and programmed to fly around obstacles or even around corners to strike a target.cIf a Slinker is fired at a target with Cover (But not Total Cover), the target does not gain the normal +5 Cover bonus to it's Reflex Defense. If an attacker wants to fire a Slinker at a target with Total Cover (Where the attacker cannot see, such as around a corner), the attacker selects a specific target square outside their line of sight and makes an attack with a +0 bonus against anything in that square. (This tactic is effective with Area Attacks, which can strike close enough to do damage even when poorly aimed.) The path from the attacker to the target square cannot have more than a single turn (Maximum 90 degrees).
Sniper Switch		KEY:SniperSwitch		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:500	DESC:A Sniper Switch allows a Weapon that can be normally fired only in Autofire mode (Such as an E-Web Repeating Blaster) to be used in Single-Fire mode. However, the Weapon no longer has reduced Autofire penalties when Braced because it is no longer an Autofire-only Weapon. Switching between the two firing modes is a Swift Action.
Bipod		KEY:Bipod		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:100			DESC:A Bipod is an attached two-legged stand that steadies the barrel of a Rifle or Heavy Weapon when Aiming or using Autofire. Preparing a Bipod for use is a Move Action, and you cannot prepare a Bipod unless you are either Prone or adjacent to low objects (Or other waist- to chest-height Cover) that are between you and your target. If you move, you cannot use the Bipod until you prepare it again. A Bipod counts as a mount for any Weapon that requires it (Such as a Heavy Repeating Blaster or an E-Web Repeating Blaster). For other Weapons, a Bipod makes Aiming easier. If you have already Aimed at or attacked a particular target, each subsequent Aim Action requires only a Swift Action. (Under these circumstances, a character with the Sniping Master Talent can Aim as a Free Action once per round.) This benefit is lost if you attack or Aim at any other target. A Bipod adds 20% to the weight of the Weapon (Minimum 1 kilogram).

###Block: Equipment Upgrades (Armor)
Internal Generator		KEY:InternalGenerator		TYPE:Armor	COST:1000	DESC:A miniaturized version of a Power Generator, an Internal Generator can provide continuous power for different Upgrades on a suit of Armor, including any Integrated Equipment. The Internal Generator can be activated or deactivated as a Swift Action. As long as it's active, an Internal Generator can simultaneously power up to ten different devices that have negligible power requirements (Anything without a listed duration). For devices with specific power requirements, an Internal Generator can store four units of energy (Each the equivalent of an Energy Cell, Power Pack, or 20 rounds of power from a Power Generator), and it automatically recharges one such unit every hour. A suit of Armor can receive this Upgrade multiple times if more energy capacity is needed, but each Internal Generator adds 10 kg to the weight of the Armor. The biggest drawback to an Internal Generator is it's energy signature. If the Internal Generator powers anything but devices with negligible power requirements, any character attempting to detect the wearer with a Sensor Pack or Vehicle Sensors gains a +5 circumstance bonus on the Perception or Use Computer check.
Jump Servos			KEY:JumpServos	TYPE:Armor	COST:500	DESC:Jump Servos are a repulsorlift-aided system that assists in making long jumps. When wearing Armor with this Upgrade, you treat all jumps as Running Jumps. Additionally, you can reroll a failed Jump check (Keeping the better of the two results) and Take 10 on Jump checks even when rushed or threatened.
Powered Exoskeleton	KEY:PoweredExoskeleton		TYPE:Armor	COST:4000	DESC:Much like the Corellian Powersuit, other Armors can be Upgraded to include a Powered Exoskeleton that enhances the physical strength of the wearer. Because of the weight and energy required, only a suit of Medium Armor or Heavy Armor can have the Powered Exoskeleton Upgrade. A Powered Exoskeleton operates for 20 rounds on a standard Energy Cell. (Suits of Armor with a Powered Exoskeleton commonly have the Internal Generator Upgrade.) Turning a Powered Exoskeleton on or off is a Swift Action. When active, the Powered Exoskeleton gives the wearer a +2 Equipment bonus to their Strength score. A Powered Exoskeleton adds 5 kg to the weight of the Armor.
Radiation Shielding	KEY:RadiationShielding	TYPE:Armor	COST:400	DESC:Radiation Shielding is necessary heavy and bulky. Only a suit of Medium Armor or Heavy Armor can be modified with Radiation Shielding, and it increases the Armor's weight by 10 kg. The Radiation Shielding grants a +10 Equipment bonus to a wearer's Fortitude Defense against Radiation attacks, and it reduces any damage dealt by a successful Radiation attack by 5 points. In addition, any time you would move -1 Persistent step down the Condition Track as a result of Radiation damage while wearing this Armor, you can make a DC 20 Endurance check to negate the Persistent Condition. You can make this check only the first time you move down the Condition Track due to a particular Radiation Hazard; if you fail, you must have the Persistent Condition cured normal (See Treat Radiation).
Ready Harness		KEY:ReadyHarness		TYPE:Armor	COST:500	DESC:A Ready Harness is a series of hooks, straps, and clips distributed around the Armor, designed to make Equipment easily accessible and to settle its weight more comfortably on the wearer's frame. A Ready Harness can hold two Small sized pieces of Equipment (Large Weapon size), five Tiny sized pieces of Equipment (Medium Weapon size), or ten pieces of Equipment up to Diminutive size (Small Weapon size). The weight of Equipment in the Ready Harness is halved for purposes of determining your Encumbrance, and such Equipment can be retrieved or replaced as a Move Action.
Repulsorlift Unit		KEY:RepulsorliftUnit		TYPE:Armor	COST:1000	DESC:his Upgrade takes the same kind of hover repulsorlifts used by Droids and modifies them to allow the Armor to float up to 1 meter off the ground. The wearer can activate or deactivate the Repulsorlift as a Swift Action. While the Repulsorlift is operating, the wearer ignores the effects of Difficult Terrain and takes half damage from Falling Damage. A Repulsorlift operates for 10 rounds on a single Energy Cell.
Shadowkin			KEY:Shadowskin		TYPE:Armor	COST:5000	DESC:A matte black finish of light- and sensor-absorbing material, a Shadowskin turns any Armor coated with it into a stealth suit. Normally coupled with a Sound Dampener (Included in this modification cost), it is difficult to see, hear, or detect the Armor with sensors. Armor with Shadowskin grants a +5 Equipment bonus on all Stealth checks made by the wearer.
Reflec Shadowskin		KEY:ReflecShadowskin		TYPE:Armor	COST:20000	DESC:A more advanced version of Shadowskin uses the material Reflec, which was developed by the Grand Army of the Republic and later used by various Imperial special forces units. Reflec is more effective but also more expensive than normal Shadowskin. A suit of Armor with Reflec Shadowskin adds a +10 Equipment bonus on it's wearer's Stealth checks.
Shield Generator (SR.5)		KEY:ShieldGenerator5		TYPE:Armor	COST:5000	DESC:A deflector Shield Generator can be built into a suit of Medium Armor or Heavy Armor, giving it the same kind of protection Starships and some Battle Droids enjoy. Due to their bulk and power requirements, it is not possible to install anything but the smallest of Shield Generators into a suit of Armor; in fact, only Heavy Armor of at least Medium size can carry a SR 10 Shield Generator. Shield Generators operate for 10 rounds on a standard Energy Cell. (Suits of Armor with Shield Generators commonly have the Internal Generator Upgrade.) Turning a Shield Generator on or off is a Swift Action. When active, reduce the damage you take by the Armor's Shield Rating. If the damage is equal to or greater than the Armor's Shield Rating, the Shield Rating is reduced by 5 points. By spending three Swift Actions on the same or consecutive rounds, the wearer can make a DC 20 Mechanics check to restore lost shield power. If the check succeeds, the Armor's Shield Rating increases by 5 points (Up to its maximum Shield Rating).
Shield Generator (SR.10)		KEY:ShieldGenerator10		TYPE:Armor	COST:10000	DESC:A deflector Shield Generator can be built into a suit of Medium Armor or Heavy Armor, giving it the same kind of protection Starships and some Battle Droids enjoy. Due to their bulk and power requirements, it is not possible to install anything but the smallest of Shield Generators into a suit of Armor; in fact, only Heavy Armor of at least Medium size can carry a SR 10 Shield Generator. Shield Generators operate for 10 rounds on a standard Energy Cell. (Suits of Armor with Shield Generators commonly have the Internal Generator Upgrade.) Turning a Shield Generator on or off is a Swift Action. When active, reduce the damage you take by the Armor's Shield Rating. If the damage is equal to or greater than the Armor's Shield Rating, the Shield Rating is reduced by 5 points. By spending three Swift Actions on the same or consecutive rounds, the wearer can make a DC 20 Mechanics check to restore lost shield power. If the check succeeds, the Armor's Shield Rating increases by 5 points (Up to its maximum Shield Rating).
Shockweb		KEY:Shockweb		TYPE:Armor	COST:500	DESC:A Shockweb is a powerful electrified stun field that can encase the entire surface of the Armor. It runs off an Energy Cell, which can power it for 20 minutes. Turning the Shockweb on or off is a Swift Action. While the Shockweb is active, any time you are the target of a successful melee attack, Grab attack, or Grapple attack, the attackers takes 1d6 electrical damage and 2d6 electrical Stun damage. Each time an attacker is damaged in this way, the Shockweb discharges 1 minute of duration off its Energy Cell.
Vacuum Seals (Standard)	KEY:VacuumSealsStandard		TYPE:Armor	COST:2000	DESC:Any Armor can be Upgraded with Vacuum Seals, which include airtight gaskets around all joints and simple Life Support Equipment that adds 2 kg of weight. This allows the Armor's wearer to survive for 10 hours in the Vacuum of space or any other hostile environment. Medium Armor and Heavy Armor can instead Upgrade themselves with Improved Vacuum Seals, which includes enough Life Support to last up to 24 hours, and adds 10 kg of weight.
Vacuum Seals (Improved)	KEY:VacuumSealsImproved	TYPE:Armor	COST:5000	DESC:Any Armor can be Upgraded with Vacuum Seals, which include airtight gaskets around all joints and simple Life Support Equipment that adds 2 kg of weight. This allows the Armor's wearer to survive for 10 hours in the Vacuum of space or any other hostile environment. Medium Armor and Heavy Armor can instead Upgrade themselves with Improved Vacuum Seals, which includes enough Life Support to last up to 24 hours, and adds 10 kg of weight.
Aquatic Adaptation		KEY:AquaticAdaptation		TYPE:Armor	COST:500	DESC:This Upgrade seals your Armor against the pressure of deep ocean travel, allows you to filter breathable air out of water indefinitely, and uses fins and small jets to allow swift and easy motion through liquids. When wearing this Armor, you gain a swim speed equal to one-half your armored walking speed and can breathe in water. Additionally, you can reroll a failed Swim check (Keeping the better of the two results) and can Take 10 on Swim checks even when rushed or threatened.
Armorplast		KEY:Armorplast		TYPE:Armor	COST:900	DESC:This Upgrades the standard Durasteel or other defensive plates of Armor with high-strength Armorplast or a similar lightweight, high-cost material. This reduces the weight of the Armor by 50%.
Climbing Claws		KEY:ClimbingClaws		TYPE:Armor	COST:200	DESC:Climbing Claws are retractable spikes worked into the arms and legs of a suit of Armor. When wearing this Armor, you gain a Climb Speed equal to one-half your your armored walking speed. Additionally, you can reroll a failed Climb check (Keeping the better of the two results) and can Take 10 on Climb checks even when rushed or threatened. The wearer can use Climbing Claws to attack foes in melee. They count as being Weapons two sizes smaller than the wearer, and they deal Slashing Damage equal to the base Claw Damage for a Beast of that size (See Allies and Opponents). For example, a Medium character would have Tiny Climbing Claws that deal 1d4 points of Slashing Damage. If your are proficient with the suit of Armor you're wearing, you are proficient with any Climbing Claws installed on it.
Diagnostics System		KEY:DiagnosticsSystem		TYPE:Armor	COST:500	DESC:A Diagnostics System is a series of sensors and simple computers that monitor both the armor and its wearer. Anyone making a Mechanics check on the armor or a Treat Injury check on its wearer gains a +2 Equipment bonus from the Diagnostics System.
Environmental Systems		KEY:EnvironmentalSystems		TYPE:Armor	COST:600	DESC:Environmental Systems come in two varieties: Cold-Weather Systems and Warm-Weather Systems. It is possible to install both in the same suit of Armor, but doing so counts as two separate Upgrades. An Environmental System makes you immune to the effects of Extreme Cold or Extreme Heat, as appropriate.
Gyro		KEY:Gyro		TYPE:Armor	COST:250	DESC:A Gyro helps keep Armor upright and stable. While wearing Armor with this Upgrade, you gain a +5 stability bonus on checks and all Defenses to resist attempts to knock you Prone.
Helmet Package		KEY:HelmetPackage		TYPE:Armor	COST:4000	DESC:When installed in the helmet of a suit of Armor, this electronic package allows the Armor to grant the wearer a +2 Equipment bonus on Perception checks as well as Low-Light Vision. In addition, it includes an integrated hands-free Comlink. Stormtrooper Armor and its variants include such a system (MFTAS, or Multi-Frequency Target Acquisition System), already included in its statistics. Installing the Helmet Package takes 1 hour, and a DC 20 Mechanics check.
Holoshroud		KEY:Holoshroud		TYPE:Armor	COST:5000	DESC:A Holoshroud Upgrade places small holographic projectors at key points around the Armor. These projectors are linked together and designed to place a holographic image over the Armor (And it's wearer). The image moves as the Armor moves, making the illusion of a different appearance difficult to penetrate. The Holoshroud can store only a single image, which must be of the same basic size and shape as the Armor (Generally humanoid). The image can be changed with an hour of work and a DC 20 Use Computer check. The Holoshroud provides a +10 Equipment bonus on Stealth checks to conceal items (Underneath the image) as well as any Deception checks made to create a Deceptive Appearance matching the image. However, the Holoshroud doesn't withstand scrutiny, so any observer who uses a Full-Round Action to search the wearer gains a +10 circumstance bonus on the opposed Perception check. Furthermore, the Holoshroud doesn't have any tactile, auditory, or olfactory component, so observers with the Scent Species Trait or using a Sensor Pack gain a +10 circumstance bonus on their Perception checks.  The Holoshroud draws power from a standard Energy Cell, which gives enough power for twenty rounds of use (Drawn in any increment). Such Armors are often Upgraded with the Extra Power Source or Internal Generator modifications to extend this operating time. You can turn a Holoshroud on or off as a Swift Action.
Integrated Equipment		KEY:IntegratedEquipment		TYPE:Armor	COST:if(%CHOICE==1,200,if(%CHOICE==2,500,if(%CHOICE==5,1000,if(%CHOICE==10,2000,0))))	CHOOSE:NUMBER|1|2|5|10|TITLE=Equipment Slots		DESC:An Integrated Equipment Upgrade attaches one piece of Equipment to the Armor per Slot. The Equipment must be three or more sizes smaller than the Armor itself. For example, Armor for a Medium character is Medium size, so it can mount Equipment up to Diminutive size (Such as Electrobinoculars, a Glow Rod, or a Medpac) or a Weapon up to Small size (Such as a Blaster Pistol or Vibroblade). This Equipment is constantly ready for use and need not be drawn or prepared before being used. Once a suit of Armor is rigged for Integrated Equipment, it becomes increasingly easy to add new pieces of Equipment as built-in modules. As a result, prices and Upgrade Slot costs are given for 1, 2, 5, and 10 Slots of Integrated Equipment (See above). It is easy to swap out the Equipment attached to Armor with this Upgrade. A single piece of Integrated Equipment can be swapped out for a different piece of gear in 10 minutes with a DC 10 Mechanics check. The price of any Equipment attached to the Armor is separate from the Integrated Equipment Upgrade cost.
