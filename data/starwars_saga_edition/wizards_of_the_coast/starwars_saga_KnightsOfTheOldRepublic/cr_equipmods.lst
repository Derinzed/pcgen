###Block: Equipment Upgrades (Weapons)
Beam Splitter		KEY:BeamSplitter		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:1200	DESC:A Weapon Accessory made only to Pistols, Rifles, Heavy Weapons, and Exotic Weapons (Ranged) that deal Energy damage, the Beam Splitter Weapon Accessory makes it easier to fire a powerful energy bolt by increasing the size of the bolt fired. Once per encounter, the wielder of a weapon with a Beam Splitter that uses the Power Blast Feat to modify an attack roll deals 2 points of damage for every 1 point subtracted from the attack bonus.
Durasteel Bonding		KEY:Durasteel Bonding		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:2000	DESC:The Durasteel Bonding Weapon Accessory coats an Advanced Melee Weapon, an Exotic Weapon (Melee), or a Simple Weapon (Melee) with a thin layer of Durasteel, making it more resistant to damage and ensuring that it retains it's keen edge over time. A weapon with Durasteel Bonding increases it's own Damage Reduction by 5 and deals an extra die of damage on a Critical Hit (This die of damage is added after damage is multiplied for the Critical Hit). This Weapon Accessory can only be placed on a weapon that deals Slashing damage.
Enhanced Energy Projector		KEY:EnhancedEnergyProjector	TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:3000	DESC:The Enhanced Energy Projector Weapon Accessory smooths the flow of power to an Advanced Melee Weapon or an Exotic Weapon (Melee) that requires a Power Pack, making it less likely to produce unpredictable results. A weapon with an Enhanced Energy Projector allows the wielder to reroll a natural 1 on any attack roll once per encounter, keeping the second result.
Hair Trigger		KEY:HairTrigger		TYPE:A modification made only to Pistols, Rifles, Heavy Weapons, and Exotic Weapons (Ranged) that use a trigger mechanism to fire, the Hair Trigger accessory makes it easier to fire several shots in quick succession by reducing the amount of pressure that must be placed on the trigger. Once per encounter, the wielder of a weapon with a Hair Trigger that uses the Rapid Shot Feat to modify an attack roll may reroll the damage from the attack, keeping the better result.
Improved Energy Cell		KEY:ImprovedEnergyCell	TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:4000	DESC:A modification made only to Pistols, Rifles, Heavy Weapons, and Exotic Weapons (Ranged) that require a Power Pack, the Improved Energy Cell accessory increases the efficiency of the energy flow between a Power Pack and the weapon's firing mechanism. A weapon with the Improved Energy Cell modification doubles the number of shots it can fire on a single Power Pack. Additionally, if the weapon has the Increased Weapon Damage Modification from the Tech Specialist Feat, the Equipment bonus to damage increases to +3.
Tremor Cell			KEY:TremorCell		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged	COST:1000	DESC:An Advanced Melee Weapon or an Exotic Weapon (Melee) that requires a Power Pack can be augmented by a Tremor Cell Weapon Accessory, allowing the wielder to subdue rather than kill an opponent by dazing it. A weapon with a Tremor Cell can be set to Stun as a Swift Action, and deals Stun damage equal to it's normal damage. Weapons larger than Medium cannot be fitted with this Weapon Accessory.


###Block: Equipment Upgrades (Armor)

Armor Reinforcement		KEY:ArmorReinforcement		TYPE:Armor	COST:3000	DESC:The Armor Reinforcement Armor Accessory increases Armor's ability to harmlessly deflect incoming attacks by coating the interior of the Armor with tough materials, adding an extra layer of defense. Reinforced Armor grants the wearer Damage Reduction 2 against Piercing damage.
Mesh Underlay		KEY:MeshUnderlay		TYPE:Armor	COST:2500	DESC:Designed with the same principals as Mesh Armor, the Mesh Underlay Armor Accessory helps channel certain types of energy away from the wearer's body, reducing the effectiveness of a potentially devastating blow. A character wearing a suit of Armor with the Mesh Underlay Armor Accessory gains a +5 Equipment bonus to their Damage Threshold against Stun damage.
